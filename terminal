# (Assuming you have already created the 'beginner_tutorials' package)

# 1. Create 'launch' and 'urdf' directories
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials
mkdir -p launch urdf
cd urdf

# 2. Create your robot's URDF file
gedit diff_drive_robot.urdf
# (Copy the URDF code into the editor and save)

# 3. Create a launch file to start Gazebo, spawn the model, and allow teleop
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/beginner_tutorials/launch
gedit spawn_and_move.launch
# (Copy the launch file code into the editor and save)

# --- Running the Simulation ---
# Open a new terminal and source your workspace.
cd ~/catkin_ws && source devel/setup.bash

# Launch the simulation
roslaunch beginner_tutorials spawn_and_move.launch
# Keep the terminal running teleop_twist_keyboard in focus to drive the robot.
